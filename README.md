# TriviaGame

This project is live on https://jacobugath.github.io/TriviaGame/

This is an assignment I did during the first half of the U of U Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The point of the assignment was to practice working with API's and Javascript timers. 

The app pulls trivia questions from an API and presents a form with multiple choice options. The user has a limited amount of time to finish each question, after which the question is marked incorrect. 

If the player chooses the incorrect answer, they are told they are are wrong and given the correct answer. 

This project succeeded in provding an easy way to test your trivia knowledge. You can start playing the game by hitting the start button. Keep selecting answers until you are informed that your quiz is complete. 

Jacobugath maintains the project create an issue for new feature requests or bugs
